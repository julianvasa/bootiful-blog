<h2>Food Blog</h2>

Developed a simple blog using:

 - Spring Boot 2
 - Multi Maven Project
 - REST API
 - SOAP API
 - Thymeleaf (hope to integrate also some other template engine)
 - Spring Data
 - Hibernate
 - MySQL DB (hope to integrate also some NoSQL DB in the future)
 - Lombok (because i am lazy and dont like to write getters/setters/constructors etc)
 - Internationalization (EN, AL)
 - Some experiments with Lambda functions
 - Pagination


The blog has a homepage which displays recent (paginated) recipes.
The recipes are grouped by categories
There is a sidebar which shows some recent posts, the categories, a kind of tag cloud, a search.
